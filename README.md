TMDb movie data contains information about 10,000 movies collected from The Movie Database (TMDb), including user ratings and revenue.



## Summary

In this this project we'll have to make operations about data wrangling, exploratory data analysis and finnally  share some conclusions.



## Key Insights for Presentation

For the presentation, I focus on just the following questions :
 - 1) What genre of movies have best votes (above average) ? 

 - 2) Do the most popular movies have the highest benefits ?

 - 3) How does inflation behave on the benefits of films from 2005 to 2015 and its relationship with popularity ?
